# Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying different types of brain tumors from MRI scans using TensorFlow/Keras. The model can classify brain tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No tumor, and Pituitary.

## 🧠 Project Overview
- **Model**: Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Input**: MRI scans of the brain
- **Output**: Classification into one of four categories
- **Classes**: Glioma, Meningioma, No tumor, Pituitary

## 🚀 Features
- Data augmentation for better model generalization
- Deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter notebook with detailed implementation
- Easy-to-use interface for predictions

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Parthiv19M/Brain_tumor_classification.git
   cd Brain_tumor_classification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook brain_tumor_classification.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the notebook cells to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate the model performance
   - Make predictions on new MRI scans

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains MRI scans of brain tumors categorized into four classes:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- No tumor
- Pituitary
